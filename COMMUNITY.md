# Community

Here are the main ways to be in touch with the Kubescape community.

## Slack

Slack is the best way to get involved or just raise a simple question. We are online in these channels through work hours (sometimes even beyond)

So, [join the CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/) and then our [users](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C04EY3ZF9GE) or [developers](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C04GY6H082K) channel.

## GitHub issues

We like issues when we need tracking for something, whether it is a bug or a feature request. We might ask you top open an issue for things that were raised in Slack to make sure there is a clear follow-up.

If you open an issue, we might ask you to move it from one project to another, but it is not a big thing. In general, if you don't know which project is relevant, [open an issue here](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/issues/new/choose)

## Community meetings

We hold [community meetings](https://zoom.us/j/95174063585) on Zoom, every other week, at 15:00 CET. ([See that in your local time zone](https://time.is/compare/1500_in_CET). :headphones:

You're more than welcome to join!

If you want to add a discussion point to the meeting, please use [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X_eyhPzJvb4ascVQ2e0jN87LAvq7lTuXT5d4gQxi8us/edit?usp=sharing) to add an item. You can also see here the summary of previous discussions. üñ•Ô∏è
